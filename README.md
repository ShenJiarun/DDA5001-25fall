The final project code for the DDA5001-25fall. Please refer to the project manual for more detailed information.

## How to start

### Part 1

All files related to part 1 of the final project are located in `p1`, and thus, before you run any code, please make sure you are in the `p1` directory.

For part 1, if you do not have enough computing resources, you'd better follow the instruction for using free GPU resources from Kaggle, please refer to [this](./Kaggle_training.md).

The main entry point of part 1 is `p1/main.ipynb`, which is a Jupyter notebook. You can run it in your local machine or in Kaggle.
